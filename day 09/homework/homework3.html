<body> <h1>ASAP ROCKY</h1>
   <div> Rakim Athelaston Mayers[2] (born October 3, 1988), known professionally as ASAP Rocky (/ˈeɪsæp/ AY-sap; stylized as A$AP Rocky), is an American rapper.[3] Born and raised in Harlem, he embarked on his musical career as a member of the hip hop collective ASAP Mob, from which he adopted his moniker. In August 2011, Mayers' single "Peso" was leaked online, and within weeks, began receiving radio airplay.[4] He signed with Polo Grounds Music, an imprint of RCA Records in October of that year, and shortly after, released his debut mixtape, Live. Love. A$AP (2011) to widespread critical acclaim.[5][6]

Mayers' 2012 single, "Fuckin' Problems" (featuring Drake, 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar), marked his first entry—at number eight—on the Billboard Hot 100, received a nomination for Best Rap Song at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, and preceded his debut studio album, Long. Live. A$AP (2013). A critical and commercial success, it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His second album, At. Long. Last. A$AP (2015), also debuted atop the chart and saw continued critical praise; its two lead singles, "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)" and "Everyday" (featuring Rod Stewart, Miguel and Mark Ronson), both received double platinum certifications by the RIAA, while its third, "L$D", was nominated for Best Music Video at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. His third album, Testing (2018), debuted within the Billboard 200's top five, while his fourth album, Don't Be Dumb, is scheduled for release in 2025.
Mayers has won a BET Award, two BET Hip Hop Awards, an MTV Video Music Award Japan and an MTVU Woodie Award. He has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, six World Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards and two MTV Europe Music Awards. Furthermore, Mayers has worked in music video direction, as well as production or co-writing for other artists, often under the pseudonym Lord Flacko.[7][8]

Early life
Rakim Athelaston Mayers was born on October 3, 1988, in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, a borough of New York City.[9] His father is from Barbados.[10] He has an older brother (deceased) and an older sister, Erika.[11][12] Both Rakim and Erika's names are taken from the Eric B. & Rakim duo.[13] His cousin is fellow ASAP Mob member ASAP Nast.[14]

Mayers started rapping at age nine, when he moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[15] He learned how to rap from his older brother, who also wore the Cornrows hairdo that A$AP Mayers later adopted. When Mayers was 13, his brother was killed in Harlem.[16] The death inspired Mayers to take rapping more seriously.[17] Mayers grew up admiring Harlem-based rap group the Diplomats. He was also influenced by Mobb Deep,[18] Three 6 Mafia, UGK, Run DMC, Wu-Tang Clan, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.[19]

When Mayers was 12 years old, his father went to jail and he spent his teenage years moving around homeless shelters with his mother and sister.[20] After living for a period in a shelter with his mother in New York City, he moved to Midtown Manhattan.[11] His father died in 2012.[21]<img src="https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2023/07/16902238056539.jpg?w=700&strip=all&quality=80" alt="asap rocky" width="300">
