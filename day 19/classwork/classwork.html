            formerly stylized as KiD CuDi), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and
            fashion designer. Born and raised in Cleveland, Cudi moved to New York City in pursuit of a musical career,
            where he first gained recognition for his song "Day 'n' Nite". Initially self-published on his MySpace page,
            the song became a hit online and served as a catalyst for Cudi to team up with record producers Plain Pat
            and Emile Haynie to record his first full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008). Its
            release helped Cudi rise to prominence and establish a fanbase, catching the attention of rapper Kanye
            West—who signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label by late 2008.[3]</h3>
