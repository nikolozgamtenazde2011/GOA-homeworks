        <h3>A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared
            tradition or set of conventions.[1] Genre is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style,
            although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.[2]

            Music can be divided into genres in numerous ways, sometimes broadly and with polarity, e.g., popular music
            as opposed to art music or folk music, or, as another example, religious music and secular music. Often,
            however, classification draws on the proliferation of derivative subgenres, fusion genres, and microgenres
            that has started to accrue, e.g., screamo, country pop, and mumble rap, respectively. The artistic nature of
            music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some may overlap. As
            genres evolve, novel music is sometimes lumped into existing categories.</h3>
