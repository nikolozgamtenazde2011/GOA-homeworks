    <h3>France,[h] officially the French Republic,[i] is a country primarily located in Western Europe. Its overseas
        regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic,
        the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it the largest discontiguous
        exclusive economic zone in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the
        north; Germany to the northeast; Switzerland to the east; Italy and Monaco to the southeast; Andorra and Spain
        to the south; and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from
        the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its
        eighteen integral regions—five of which are overseas—span a combined area of 632,702 km2 (244,288 sq mi) and
        have an estimated total population of over 68.6 million as of January 2025. France is a semi-presidential
        republic. Its capital, largest city and main cultural and economic centre is Paris.

        Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area
        in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom of
        Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the
        empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful
        but decentralised feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a
        dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, French culture flourished
        during the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the
        conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was
        successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.</h3>
