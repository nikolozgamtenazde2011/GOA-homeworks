        <p class="p1">Parrots have strong curved beaks that help them crack nuts and seeds easily. 
                Their feet have two toes facing forward and two backward, allowing them to grip branches tightly. 
                They also have bright feathers that not only make them colorful but help with flight and protection. 
                Parrots are known for their sharp eyesight and the ability to mimic sounds, thanks to their well-developed vocal organs.</p>
