    <h3><b><span style=background-color:purple>pride</span></b>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly
        sins, considered by some to be the gravest of all sins. In the theological sense, pride is defined as an
        excessive love of one’s own excellence. As a deadly sin, pride is believed to generate other sins and further
        immoral behaviour and is countered by the heavenly virtue of humility.</h3>

    <h3><span style=background-color:gold>greed</span>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly sins. Greed
        is defined as the immoderate love or desire for riches and earthly possessions. A person can also be greedy for
        fame, attention, power, or anything else that feeds one’s selfishness. As a deadly sin, greed is believed to
        spur other sins and further immoral behavior. According to Catholic theology, it can be countered with the
        heavenly virtue of charity or generosity.</h3>

        <h3><span style=background-color:pink>lust</span>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly sins.
            According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, issued by the Vatican in 1992, lust is the “disordered
            desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure.” It goes on to state that “sexual pleasure is morally
            disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes.” A person can have a
            lust for power or material things, but in its moral and spiritual usages the term lust typically refers to
            sexual activities.</h3>

        <h3><span style=background-color:green>envy</span>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly
            sins. The theological definition of envy is resentment or sadness at another’s good fortune or excellence,
            with an often insatiable desire to have it for oneself. Envy is more than simple jealousy because it
            includes the belief that another’s excellence or blessings lessens one’s own, and it makes one want to
            destroy another’s good fortune. As a deadly sin, envy is believed to generate other sins and further immoral
            behaviour; it can be countered with the heavenly virtue of gratitude.</h3>

        <h3><span style=background-color:orange>gluttony</span>gluttony, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven
            deadly sins. Gluttony is defined as excess in eating and drinking. Although eating and drinking for pleasure
            is not seen as sinful, eating or drinking to excess beyond reason is a sin. Drunkenness, which is caused by
            excessive consumption of intoxicating beverages, is considered a type of gluttony. As a deadly sin, gluttony
            is believed to spur other sins and further immoral behavior.</h3>

            <h1><span style=background-color:red>wrath</span></h1>
        </center>
        <h3><span style=background-color:red>wrath</span>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly
            sins. Wrath is defined as a strong feeling of hatred or resentment with a desire for vengeance. This
            overwhelming feeling and desire for revenge distinguishes wrath from anger that is balanced with reason,
            which is not a sin. Christian teaching also differentiates between God’s wrath and human wrath, in that the
            wrath of God is regarded as a manifestation of divine righteousness and justice. As a deadly sin, wrath is
            believed to generate other sins and further immoral behavior. Each deadly sin has a countering “heavenly
            virtue” that overcomes its opposing vice; the heavenly virtue that counters wrath is patience.

            </center>
            <h3><span style=background-color:cyan>sloth</span>, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly
                sins. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, issued by the Vatican in 1992, sloth is the
                “culpable lack of physical or spiritual effort.” The terms sloth and acedia are often used
                interchangeably, but some theologians distinguish acedia as a form of spiritual sloth that stems from
                laxity in spiritual or ascetic practices, which leads to discouragement and temptation. Therefore,
                “busyness” can be regarded as a form of sloth, because it may involve preoccupying oneself with worldly
                things to avoid spiritual or inner reflection. Unlike mere laziness, the sin of sloth conveys a willful
                refusal of the joy that comes from God’s love and even repels divine goodness.
