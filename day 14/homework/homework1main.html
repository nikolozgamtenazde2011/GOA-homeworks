    <h3>Hip-hop or hip hop (originally disco rap) is a popular music genre that emerged in the early 1970s from the
        African-American community of New York City. The style is characterized by its synthesis of a wide range of
        musical techniques. Hip-hop includes rapping often enough that the terms can be used synonymously. However,
        "hip-hop" more properly denotes an entire subculture. Other key markers of the genre are the disc jockey,
        turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks. Cultural interchange has always been central to
        the hip-hop genre. It simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.
        The hip-hop genre and culture emerged from block parties in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City,
        particularly Bronx. DJs began expanding the instrumental breaks of popular records when they noticed how excited
        it would make the crowds. The extended instrumental breaks provided a platform for break dancers and rappers.
        These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were disco due
        to its popularity at the time.</h3>
